Index: 
	Can be beginning or end. Not completely neccesary, but helpful

Other things to address in Docs:
	Sandboxes
		the one under which to grade
		virtual filesystem (for future)
	Testing
		list of SRFI testing procedures used in MAGS
			so that somebody doesn't have to train
			another person to write test suites for 
			MAGS.


Questions:
	How to make the test files? test cases? terminology?
	How to grade the assignment?
	Why does it matter why we include or load the files
		that we want to use (in regards to SRFI :64)?
	Ticks in scheme? <------Infinite Loop Problem

Problems to address:
	test-eventually doesn't stop
		if requirements aren't met, it just keeps going
	infinite loop problem
