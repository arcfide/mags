@* Introduction
This library contains procedures for constructing and 
manipulating a virtual file system for a sandbox environment.

@* Overview.
This library creates a sandbox virtual file system. The main purpose
of this sandbox is to enable the mags auto-grading system to grade
scheme code that can input/output to files. By creating a virtual
file system, space usage will be able to be controlled as well as
the ability to maintain the integrity of the top-level filesystem.
