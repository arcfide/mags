(@* "Overview"
"This library creates a basic framework for a virtual filesystem for the sandbox.
The advantage of this is to control and monitor space use 
as well as allow for extensive manipulation without
threatening the integrity or structure of the original filesystem. 
\\medskip 
\\noindent 
The |(current-vfs)|is initialized to (dir \"/\"), and can be changed by
simply using it as a parameter. Specifics about the |(current-vfs)| an be
found in the following section, titled \"Virtual Filesystems\". You can
use any of the r6rs convenience I/O and filesystem operations in this library.

")

(@* "Nodes"
"Nodes are representative of either files or directories. Files, which
are pairs containing a name and contents, look like this: 
\\medskip 
\\verbatim
> (file \"name\" . \"contents\")
|endverbatim
\\medskip
\\noindent
If the file has an {\\it open} port, the contents will be that
port. When you write to a port that is open in a node and then close
it, the port is replaced by whatever was written. The |(current-vfs)|
is the current virtual filesystem. Here is an example of writing to a node:
\\medskip
\\verbatim
> (current-vfs (file \"submission\" . \"Something\")
> (define a (open-output-port \"submission\")
> a
<output-port submission>
> (current-vfs)
(file \"submission\" . <output port submission>)
> (write \"Something\" a)
> (close-output-port a)
> (current-vfs)
(file \"submission\" . \"Something\")
|endverbatim
\\medskip
When we close the 
\\medskip
\\noindent
Directories are simply nodes that contain a list of other nodes 
as their contents, for example:
\\medskip
\\verbatim
(dir \"/\"
     (file \"submission\" . \"This is a submission file\")
     (file \"foo\" . \"bar\")
     (dir \"cd\"
	  (file \"name\" . \"contents\")))
|endverbatim
\\medskip
\\noindent
Here are some specific properties about nodes:
\\medskip
\\unorderedlist
\\li Nodes are pairs.
\\li Nodes can represent either a file or directory.
\\li Both |file| nodes and |dir| nodes have an identifier at the |car|,
either 'file or 'dir.\\smallskip
{\\it Example: (file name . contents) and (dir (file name . contents))}
\\li The |name| of a file or dir is a string representing the name.
\\li The |contents| of a node can be one of two things: 
\\smallskip
\\noindent
\\endunorderedlist)"

(@* "Virtual Filesystems"
"Virtual filesystems assure that we can keep the top-level filesystem intact while
performing operations. 
\\medskip
\\noindent
|current-vfs| is a parameter that represents the current virtual
filesystem that the sandbox is using. Each item in the list represents
a |node|, which is essentially a path to the file which will be read
into the sandbox. Specifics about nodes are explained in the above section."

"To support the virtual file system we must have a way to create ports
that are directly linked to the virtual file system that we create.
These are then used as the underlying framework for the above
rewritten procedures.  We support input and output text ports at the
moment, but not input/output ports or binary ports.  The basic idea is
that when passed a file node, these procedures close over this node
and create a port whose effects are visible in the node contents
field.

(make-virtual-textual-output-port file-node)

\\noindent
Both of the above procedures return a port.  They mutate the contents
field of the |file-node|. It is important to note that while the
port they return is open, that fact will be reflected in the contents field
of a file node.  Here is an example interaction that should illustrate
this:

\\medskip\\verbatim
> (define file-node (cons* 'file \"test_file\" \"Something\"))
> file-node
(file \"test_file\" . \"Something\")
> (define op (make-virtual-textual-output-port file-node))
> op
#<text output port>
> file-node
(file \"test_file\" . #<text output port>)
> (put-string op \"This isn't something.\n\")
> file-node
(file \"test_file\" . #<text output port>)
> (close-port op)
> file-node
(file \"test_file\" . \"This isn't something.\n\")
> 
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent
Note that the actual effects of the writing are not visible in the
node itself until that output port has been closed.  This actually
means that we are enforcing a single access restriction on the file
nodes.")

port from the node, with the file node's name as the |id| and we will
use close to restore the file node.  During the actual opening of the
file node, we mutate the node cell so that its contents reflects that
we have opened the file.  In this case, we replace the contents with
the port that we have just created."
